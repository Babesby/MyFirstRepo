What I have learned from this course
One thing I’ve learned so far in this course is the importance of clear planning and problem-solving in entrepreneurship. It’s not just about having a great idea; it’s about understanding your target audience, testing your solution, and building something that truly adds value. I’ve also realized how essential feedback is in shaping and improving both the product and my personal growth as a future business leader.
