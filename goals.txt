My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year

Academic Goals
Maintain a Strong GPA
I’m aiming to finish with nothing less than a 3.7 CGPA. That means staying consistent with assignments, asking for help when I need it, and managing my time smarter—not harder.

Complete Key Courses with Excellence
Especially in the areas of software engineering, entrepreneurship, and data handling. I don’t want to just pass, I want to understand and apply what I learn.

Start or Join a Research or Innovation Project
Whether in mental health tech, climate solutions, or youth advocacy. I want my learning to be relevant and impactful.

Strengthen My Public Speaking and Communication Skills
Through presentations, group projects, and maybe even campus events. The ability to pitch, explain and represent ideas clearly is non-negotiable for me.

Personal Goals
Grow in Self-Discipline and Focus
I’m choosing habits that make me sharper—early rising, regular journaling, planning my week in advance, and limiting distractions.

Develop Tranquiliva Further
I want to push the app further, onboard more users, and build a small but strong community around mental wellness.

Take Better Care of My Mental and Physical Health
That means rest without guilt, eating well, and having a support system. I don’t want to burn out; I want to sustain my glow.

Travel, Network, and Seek Mentorship
I’m open to fellowships, leadership programs, and events that expand my worldview. I want to grow in rooms where I’m both learning and contributing.

Embrace Joy and Celebrate Wins (big or small)
I’ll take time to smile more, dance more, and acknowledge how far I’ve come—even when things get hard.

In Summary
I want next year to be about alignment, not perfection. About depth, not just doing more. And most of all, I want to stay grounded in God, my values, and my vision.
